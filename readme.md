Shortest Path
=============

An exploration of searching graphs for a shortest path

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After completing this lab, students will be able to:

- Implement graph search algorithms in Python
- Understand the costs and benefits of breadth-first, depth-first, and Dijkstra's algorithm

Task
----

Examine the included graph data in [nodes.csv](nodes.csv) and [edges.csv](edges.csv). Handout code is provided to load, process, and display this data in [search.py](search.py)

Implement `search_depth_first`, `search_dijkstra`, and `search_breadth_first` so that all included tests pass.
